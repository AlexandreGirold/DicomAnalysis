"""
The goal in this file is similar to mlc_davinci/leaf_alignment.py but adapted, so instead of taking 
only 40mm (coordinates of 0, 40), it can be anything from 0,20 10,30 or 20,40
The goal is to provide the bottom and top coordinates of the leaf alignment area (for each of the 28 leaves)
as well as the height of the leaves.
